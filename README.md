üìò Requirement Analysis in Software Development
üß© Introduction

This repository explores the concept of Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
The goal is to understand how software requirements are gathered, analyzed, and documented to ensure that the final product meets user needs and business objectives.

It includes key topics such as:

The importance of requirement analysis

Functional and non-functional requirements

Requirement gathering techniques

Documentation and validation processes

‚ùì What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of collecting, understanding, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project. It is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it lays the foundation for all subsequent stages, including design, development, testing, and maintenance.

Key Points:

Purpose: To ensure the software meets the users‚Äô needs and business objectives.

Activities Involved: Gathering requirements through interviews, surveys, observations, and workshops; analyzing and prioritizing requirements; documenting them clearly.

Importance in SDLC:

Prevents misunderstandings between clients and developers.

Reduces development costs by identifying issues early.

Provides a clear roadmap for design and implementation.

Ensures the final product aligns with stakeholder expectations.

In essence, Requirement Analysis acts as a bridge between what the client wants and what the development team delivers, making it one of the most crucial steps in building successful software.
