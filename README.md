üìò Requirement Analysis in Software Development
üß© Introduction

This repository explores the concept of Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
The goal is to understand how software requirements are gathered, analyzed, and documented to ensure that the final product meets user needs and business objectives.

It includes key topics such as:

The importance of requirement analysis

Functional and non-functional requirements

Requirement gathering techniques

Documentation and validation processes

‚ùì What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of collecting, understanding, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project. It is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it lays the foundation for all subsequent stages, including design, development, testing, and maintenance.

Key Points:

Purpose: To ensure the software meets the users‚Äô needs and business objectives.

Activities Involved: Gathering requirements through interviews, surveys, observations, and workshops; analyzing and prioritizing requirements; documenting them clearly.

Importance in SDLC:

Prevents misunderstandings between clients and developers.

Reduces development costs by identifying issues early.

Provides a clear roadmap for design and implementation.

Ensures the final product aligns with stakeholder expectations.

In essence, Requirement Analysis acts as a bridge between what the client wants and what the development team delivers, making it one of the most crucial steps in building successful software.


üîë Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

The following are the five key activities involved in Requirement Analysis:

Requirement Gathering:
Collecting information from stakeholders, users, and other sources to understand the overall needs and goals of the project.

Requirement Elicitation:
Actively engaging with stakeholders using interviews, questionnaires, workshops, and observations to extract detailed requirements.

Requirement Documentation:
Clearly recording the gathered requirements in a structured format, such as Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), to ensure everyone has a shared understanding.

Requirement Analysis and Modeling:
Examining, refining, and organizing requirements to identify conflicts, redundancies, or gaps. Modeling tools like use-case diagrams or data flow diagrams are often used.

Requirement Validation:
Ensuring that documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are feasible, testable, and complete before development begins.
